This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-heartbeat layer.
This repository contains the implementation of a hearth rate monitor, which is made of two
components:
- A Linux character-based driver (mycdd) used to access a “virtual” Photopletismography (PPG) sensor
- A Linux user application (heartbeat)

To build a Linux distribution using the Yocto build system we need to start by downloading the source repositories.
The Linux meta-distribution (the source code from which our custom Linux distribution, i.e., bootloader, kernel,root file system containing system and user programs would be built) 
is called Poky.

After you've done all the steps for setting up poky, you can download this repository.

In this github repository it is located the layer named "meta-heartbeat".

You can download the repository with the command <git clone https://github.com/lucafdl/OSES.git> 
Then you have to move the repository in your poky directory.

After doing this, do this commands:

cd poky
source oe-init-build-env build_qemuarm
bitbake-layers add-layer ../heartbeat/

So, you added the layer. Inside the layer we have two recipes in recipes-example:
- "heartbeat" for the linux application; 
- "mycdd" for the character-based driver;


Next, edit the local.conf file located in build_qemuarm / conf, adding the following lines:
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " heartbeat" 
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " mycdd"
KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "mycdd"

These lines tell Yocto that, when building Linux, the newly created device driver shall be built, and that it shall be
included in the root file system.

At the end you can re-build the image with the new layer with:

bitbake core-image-minimal.

You can test the application by running the "runqemu qemuarm" command and and after it opens, use the "heartbeat" command. 
We can see every time he invokes the read function of the cdd and after a few seconds the result of the heartbeat measurement which is 76bpm.
It's possible to use Eclipse,configured for Yocto, by the debugging heartbeat.c.
